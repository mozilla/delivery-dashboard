## Linting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format all `.js` and `.css` files
according to the default configuration of Prettier.

When contributing, it is your responsibility to make sure all files you
touch conform to the Prettier standard, but there are useful tools to make
this easier.

Linting is checked in continuous integration for every pull request and
build of `master`. If any file has any deviation from the Prettier output
it will "break the build" and you're expected to fix it.

To make it easier to see what the potential linting problems are run:

```sh
$ yarn lint
```

It will report any errors and explain which files need attention. To
make this more convenient you can simply run:

```sh
$ yarn lint-fix
```

which will directly fix the files that didn't pass.
